“Happy Bucket” is an application that that helps you to organize your directories, by sending files into their proper destination automatically. You can set rules for individual folder, and define how files should be handled once they are added to the folder.

First, click the “Service” tab from the left to see the list of available functionalities. Before utilizing any of these services, I must put in my authentication credential. This step is only necessary the first time.
Then, go to the “Rules” tab. Here, I want all image files to be uploaded to Picasa and all video files to be uploaded to Facebook when they are added to my “Media” folder. To do that, I first browser for my “Media” folder, then define the file type. Finally, I choose a service. Image goes to Picasa, and video goes to Facebook, then click “Save”. 
Now let’s see if it works. On my desktop, I find a JPEG file, a MP4 file and a Word Doc. Selecting both of them at the same time, I drag and drop them into the “Media” folder. The rule I have configured a few minutes ago show command “Happy Bucket” application to process the JPEG and MP4, but leave the Word doc un affected. Let’s check.
